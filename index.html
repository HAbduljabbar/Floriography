<p>The practice of using flowers to communicate coded messages, known as Floriography or the "language of flowers," is a fascinating historical and cultural phenomenon. While the symbolism of flowers dates back thousands of years across various cultures, its most popular and codified form emerged during the Victorian era (1837â€“1901) in Great Britain and the United States. In this intricate communication system, the color of the flower, along with its species, arrangement, and even presentation, played a crucial role in conveying specific sentiments and emotions that social etiquette often forbade speaking aloud.</p>
<h2>The Role of Color in Floriography</h2>
<p>In floriography, the color of a flower is a primary component of its symbolic meaning, often modifying or intensifying the message of the bloom itself. Different colors developed widely accepted, though not entirely universal, interpretations:</p>
<p>In this article we will illustrate the use of only three color of flowers which are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Red Flower</li>
  <li>White Flower</li>
  <li>Yellow Flower</li>
</ol>
<h2> Red Flower </h2>
<p>The red flower usually used to represent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deep love,</li>
  <li>passion,</li>
  <li>desire,</li> <li>courage,</li> <li>respect.</li>
</ul>

<h2> White Flower </h2>

<p> The white flower usually used to represent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purity,</li> <li>innocence, </li>humility, <l>reverence, </li>sympathy, <l>modesty, </li><li>new beginnings.</li>
</ul>
<h2> yalow Flower </h2>
<img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/ylang-ylang-flower-24771734.jpg?w=768" alt="yalow flower" width="200">
<p> The yellow flower usually used to represent:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Friendship,</li> <li>joy,</li> <li>happiness,</li> <li>new beginnings. (Historically: jealousy or decrease of love, depending on the flower).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Therefore by carefully selecting a variety of colored flowers, an individual could construct a complex</strong> <em>"talking bouquet"</em> <strong>to communicate a detailed message without speaking a single word.</strong></p>
